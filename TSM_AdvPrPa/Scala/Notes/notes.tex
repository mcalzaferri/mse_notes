\section*{Multiple inheritance}
\subsection*{Problems}
\subsubsection*{Duplicated method / field}
If 2 superclasses / interfaces define the same method / field, which is invoked and how.

This is handled differently in Java / C# and C++.
\subsubsection*{Diamond inheritance problem}
What if 2 superclasses have the same baseclass. (forming a diamond)

Do all superclasses get their own copy of fields and methods?

For example in C++ for all superclasses a separate method and field is added. They can be accessed by casting the class to one of its superclasses.
Directly accessing such a method / field on the class itself will throw an exception as it is unclear which one to use.

If this is not wanted, virtual inheritance can be used, creating the field only once,
